# Edaf05Labs

These are my solutions for the Labs in the course EDAF05 - Algorithms and Datastructure at Lund University

## Running the Labs

There is an SH file in each lab folder, run this. Look in the file how to do this.
These files are from the lableader.

If you make changes make sure to put the .class files in the labfolder first

## Project Structures
in each of the Lab folders, there is a project called solution edit this to chnage the project.
Remember to put the class files in the root of the labfolder first.

### Multiple Solution Files
Sometimes there are multiple methods in a file or multiple classes in the solution.
These are different approcaches i used to the problem when i had fought with the given approach for a while.
The newest one is usually the one with the highest numer attached to it.
